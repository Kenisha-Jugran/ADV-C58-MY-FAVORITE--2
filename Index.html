        <p>Hobbies are of different kinds and each person would be having different kind of hobbies. Singing, dancing, painting, photography, cooking, gardening and the list is just endless.It basically depends on the interest of the person on what kind of hobby they possess. In my case, I would say that my hobby is Singing and I just love to sing at every possible chance that I could.Right from my childhood, I used to love songs and I used to listen to many different kinds of songs. Then when I started picking up on the lyrics, my parents realized that I really had a passion for music.From then on, I never looked back. I am working very hard to achieve my goal. I hope one day I will become a great singer.</p>
